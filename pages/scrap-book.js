                  I have worked with YOMA several times over the last 4 years and found their partnership to be outstanding! They have partnered with us on large national scale projects like the Permanent Journey Plan for our sales frontline which was taken up as a best practice by our Foods business later. The feedback on the same was very positive both from a quality perspective as well as from a quality of service perspective. The team spends considerable time and effort behind understanding our requirements, when we go to them with a project and then comes up with a working prototype which helps us make informed decisions on the project. They are always ready to take feedback, make changes and come back with an excellent finished product.

                  It has been a pleasure working with the YOMA team. The track smart platform has been designed to help us automate the merchandising part of the Instore Visibility and provide us with real time market feedback. Their artificial intelligence technology will also help us in reducing cost of doing the audit thereby giving us the scale and automation. Look forward to working with the Yoma team again

                  We thought of going directly to the customers through a project called Go Direct, YOMA Business has been pretty instrumental in getting us the required support for the project.The best part was that YOMA not only giving us the sourcing, but they had dedicated manpower who understands what we wanted. YOMA has pretty helpful and useful in getting the desired result that we wanted.

We are facing is to get their salary on time, the distributor will supposed to pay their salary and travelling expenses.We are keeping on thinking how we should align with distributors, with the people get their salary on time.In a mean while we got the opportunity to work with YOMA, What we found is the kind of follow up and a kind of support we are looking in terms of services and facilities is very commendable. Now, the team is getting their salary and travelling expenses on time.
